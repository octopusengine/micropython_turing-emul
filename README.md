ESP32 &amp; MicroPython - turing machine emulator

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.

## Emulator

The program is loaded as a text file (programs_turing/program.txt) where **each line represents a transition function of the form 𝛿(𝑝,𝑋)=(𝑞,𝑌,D)**, so the 5 tuples are strictly in the order p, X, Y, D, q *(the character _ represents a blank symbol on the tape)*
